ToDos:
    - A climbing mechanic
    - If the rightcollider != null, turn the player around, and vice versa
        - And then, enable shooting while wall clinging
    - XP for clearing a room of enemies
    - Keep working on pulse jump
    - Make a stage system
        - Assign exclusive chunks to each stage, which means I need to make more chunks. After x stages, we can have a
            boss battle, or a timed room
            - Use the pause menu as a reference to build this stage selector
            
    
    - Make a minimap to work with randomly generated levels (new branch)
        - Make the map very simple; show only the rooms present in the level
        - The player will be in the highlighted room

    - Use RNGCryptoServiceProvider for level generation:

    Bugs:
        - HP number not incrementing
            - Removed for now. Not as important to fix as other bugs
        - Player does not jump in starting room more than twice
            - First it calls altjump, then double jump
                - It's doing this because the game believes the player isn't grounded in the starting chunks
                - Delete the first chunk after it's instantiated, then re-instantiate
                    - Or maybe instantiating the player through the script???

    Technical:
        Saving: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oRVMCRCvN0 (save game after each stage completion)

    Notes:
    - Make an algorithm that dynamically chooses which room type to place on each spawn point
        - This can help speed up level development and will make it easier to develop larger levels + more levels, potentially hundreds

    Game loop:
        - Pick a stage, run, jump, walljump your way to the end
        - Engage enemies in combat
        - Safety rooms to replenish health and ammo
        - Gain XP by killing enemies, finding secret items, and clearing levels


    - My own font?

        - Endurance rooms? Should be LRT type.
            - These rooms will close shut until the player has killed the boss in the room
            - Implement for later levels
        - 25-50 stages the player can choose from
            - All pseudo-randomly generated (core visual design stays the same but rooms can be swapped out for other rooms)
                - This will give me more control on how to design a level, while offering a somewhat new experience to the player when they revisit the level
                - XP is awarded per enemy kill (applied after satge completion). XP can be applied to the player's overall level at the end of a level
                - To keep things simple, I might offer a % based system of a flat value

        - Health pickup sound

    Enemy ideas:
        - Stationary turrets
            - Firing both ways/one way
            - Wall mounted/moving vertically/horizontally
        - Turret with moving barrel
            - Use Vector2 object, run it through a for loop to iterate z value till it reaches
                a certain point. Reverse
        - Bombs that arm when the player gets too close
