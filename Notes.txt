    Notes:
        - Bombs that arm when the player gets too close
        - At the end of each level will be the Nova Room.
            - Nova Room will give the player the chance to allocate Nova Gems to skills to power them up, use Nova Gems to buy items, or invest in power ups
                - Upgrading skills:
                    - You can assign Nova Gems to skills to upgrade them. The upgraded versions can be found
                        in levels hereafter. Same thing applies to power ups
            - If the player dies, they lose all Nova Gems in possession, plus any items.
        - Endurance rooms? Should be LRT type.
            - These rooms will close shut until the player has killed the boss in the room
            - Implement for later levels

    Enemy ideas:
        - Tiny bugs which travel in groups
            - Target the player
        - Stationary turrets
            - Firing both ways/one way
            - Wall mounted
